👋 Hi, I’m @HHHnne

👀 I’m passionate about cyber security and dedicated to safeguarding digital environments from emerging threats. I have a particular interest in ethical hacking, secure coding practices, and the development of innovative security solutions.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my expertise in Python and Golang, focusing on malware analysis and the creation of antivirus evasion techniques that push the boundaries of traditional security measures.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge the status quo of cyber defense, especially those that involve crafting cutting-edge tools and strategies for threat detection and response. I'm also interested in contributing to the open-source community and participating in collaborative research that advances the field of network security.
